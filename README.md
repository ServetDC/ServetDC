- 👋 Hi, I’m @ServetDC
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Coding
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... How to code, dropshipping, and finance management
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... a project around coding and programming/making softwares not to big not to small and complicated
- 📫 How to reach me ... DO NOT have a current form of contact at the moment.
- 😄 Pronouns: ... He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... When i got into coding i was originally interested in cyber-security later migrated to coding in css, and js, html, as well as python (all in the learning)
- 📂 Project: My project name is SecureFortify and what it's suppose to do is offer security and and easy acces to your saved passwords while all you need to do is remember one SINGLE main password to get into SecureFortify then when you login you can access your account and see all your passwords. The reason why I decided to start this project is to provide a safe place to put all your passwords incase you get hacked and someone gets youre information they wont have 0 to none of your passwords, I still do need a team and a website domain but when I have the resources I will be starting project SecureFortify.
